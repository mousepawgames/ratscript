Ratscript
=====================

**Ratscript** is designed to be a multi-paradigm runtime
interpreted language with a simple syntax and a high-performance
standard library. Ratscript 2.0 "Norvegicus" is currently in
development. See the [official project page][1].

Some of the planned features of Ratscript are:

 - Simple, obvious syntax.
 - User-friendly error codes.
 - A high-efficiency memory management system built from scratch.
 - Full built-in Unicode support.
 - Offers functional, OOP, and generic programming paradigms.
 - Introduces brand new "synaptic programming" paradigm.
 - First programming language to offer ternary (tri-bit) atomic datatype.
 - Can be connected to other projects' APIs.
