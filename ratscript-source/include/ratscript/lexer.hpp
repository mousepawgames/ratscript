/*
Lexer needs:
- A token class that has each token and its attributes (type, lexeme, object,
line location in code)
- a list of token types (enumeration)
- a way to discern where lexemes begin and end (recognize single character
    lexemes, then look for multi character, etc)
- a way to identify lexemes and tokenize them
- something to do with garbage input

Use SIMPLExpress
